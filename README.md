# MOLI

This repository has data-driven modeling algorithms based on the Matchable-Observable Linear Identification (MOLI) approach.

For details on the method, refer to
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7552434 (General concept)
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7962944 (Continuous-time model version)
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7587915 (Recursive estimation version)

The extension to Linear-parameter varying systems (LPV) is approched in
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7526668
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8264342

Fell free to use the algorithms. I hope to make all the algorithm versions (i.e., recursive, LPV) available soon. We just ask you to give the credits of algorithms used by citing us. Any comments about the algorithms or eventual issues report are more than welcome. Enjoy!
